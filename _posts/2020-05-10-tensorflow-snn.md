title: Tensorflow Spiking Neural Network
---

I implemented a Spiking Neural Network using Tensorflow, check it out on [Github](https://github.com/jotia1/spiking-net-tensorflow). 
This is a proof-of-concept project as the types of learning I am interested in are not well represented in Tensorflow. 
This was a fun project and has become my most popular repository with 39 stars and 13 forks!
