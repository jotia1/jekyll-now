title: Python implementation of SDVL
---

I am currently working on porting my matlab implementation of the delay learning rule Synaptic Delay Variance Learning (SDVL) to python. 
Moving to python should make the code much more maintainable and accessible, it is still under active development but you can check out the progress at [Python SDVL](https://github.com/jotia1/pythonSDVL).
