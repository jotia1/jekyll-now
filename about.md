I love exploring new tech and pushing the boundries of what is possible with it. I'm particuarly interested in the intersection of cloud computing and machine learning, and how these technologies can be leveraged to create scalable solutions. I love teaching and have a real passion for education and mentoring.

In my PhD I worked with unsupervised learning in spiking neural networks with varying types and intensities of noise. Specifically, I studied how the plasticity of action potential conduction delays can be used as a functional computational mechanism similar to weight learning in networks of spiking neurons. 

In my spare time I like to try out new hobbies like watchmaking and 3D printing, or take my dogs out adventuring.
