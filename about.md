I'm a final year PhD student at the Unversity of Queensland working in computational neuroscience. 
In my PhD I am studying how the time it takes for neurons to send signals to eachother can affect the kinds of computation they do. 
In more academic jargon; I am studying how the plasticity of action potential conduction delays can be used as a functional computational mechism similar to weight learning in networks of spiking neurons. 

Some keywords of things I like think about in no particular order:
- Oscillations
- Temporal coding
- Recurrent networks
- Conduction delays
- Spatiotemporal learning / representations
- Non-linear dynamics / chaos / sync
- Self organisation
