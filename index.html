This website serves to host content on the various projects (both academic and less academic) that I have worked on. 
I am always interested in collaborations so let me know if something interests you.
My current interests are on computationally focused neural models, checkout <a href="https://github.com/jotia1">my github profile</a> for my most recent activity or browse below for some of my more established work.
